## Overview

This application applies supervised machine learning to the problem of automated stellar object classification — one of the foundational challenges of large-scale photometric sky surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Given a set of photometric magnitudes (u, g, r, i, z bands) and the spectroscopic redshift of an observed object, the model classifies it as a Star, Galaxy, or Quasar (QSO) with calibrated probability scores.

The Streamlit interface provides two modes: interactive single-object classification with visual output, and batch classification from an uploaded CSV file containing multi-object survey data. The model is trained on the SDSS DR17 photometric-spectroscopic catalogue and achieves classification accuracy exceeding 97% on the held-out test set, with the highest confusion between faint galaxies and quasars at high redshift — a known challenge in observational astronomy.

Beyond classification, the application includes an interactive colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) visualisation and a 2D/3D feature space projection (PCA or UMAP) coloured by class label, giving users intuition for the photometric separability of the three object classes in the training data.

## Motivation

Modern sky surveys generate billions of stellar observations — far more than can be manually reviewed by astronomers. Automated photometric classification is therefore a critical pipeline step in survey astronomy, enabling efficient targeting of follow-up spectroscopic observations for objects of scientific interest. This project demonstrates that a well-engineered ML pipeline can achieve spectroscopic-grade classification accuracy from photometric features alone.

## Features

### Photometric Feature Input
Enter u, g, r, i, z apparent magnitudes and spectroscopic redshift through validated number inputs. Colour indices (u-g, g-r, etc.) are computed automatically as derived features.

### Three-Class Stellar Classifier
Outputs class probabilities for Star, Galaxy, and Quasar using a trained multi-class classifier with >97% accuracy on SDSS DR17 data.

### Colour-Magnitude Diagram
Interactive CMD plot with training data points, colour-coded by class, with the user's input object overlaid for visual context.

### PCA / UMAP Feature Projection
2D and 3D projections of the feature space coloured by class label, helping users understand the photometric separability of stellar object classes.

### Confusion Matrix and Metrics
Full evaluation panel: confusion matrix, per-class precision/recall/F1, and macro/weighted averages on the test split.

### Batch CSV Classification
Upload a CSV of photometric observations for bulk classification with a downloadable results table including class labels and confidence scores.

### Redshift Distribution Plot
Histogram of the training redshift distribution by class, contextualising the user's input object within the population.

### Model Selection Sidebar
Toggle between trained classifiers (RF, SVM, KNN, XGBoost) and observe how class boundaries and accuracy metrics change.

## Notes

Classification accuracy varies with survey depth and photometric noise. The model performs best on well-measured objects (low photometric uncertainty). High-redshift QSOs may be confused with compact blue galaxies.
